# Personal Website

Welcome to the source code for my personal website, [martindieck.com](https://martindieck.com)!

This site serves as a digital portfolio and resume where you can learn more about me—my background, skills, and what I’ve been working on. It’s a simple and clean HTML/CSS-based site hosted via GitHub Pages.

## About the Site

This site was built to:

- Showcase my work and professional experience  
- Serve as a living resume  
- Share a bit about who I am and what I’m passionate about  

It’s intentionally lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- Hosted with **GitHub Pages**

There’s no backend or complex build system—just good ol’ static web.

There is, however, a contact form that utilises **FormSpree** to bypass the GitHub Pages static page limitations and allow for form requests.

## Repository Purpose

This repo exists mostly for transparency and archival. Feel free to explore the code if you're curious!

## Contact
